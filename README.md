# Texas Hold 'Em Helper

Texas Hold Em' Helper is a program designed to help teach players who are new to this variant of poker on how to critically think about the plays they make during a game of it, encouraging players to make specific plays based on their hand and the available public cards on the table.

## Installation

To install and use Texas Hold Em' Helper, you will need a Java compiler. Eclipse IDE was used for the development and testing of the program, so it is suggested here.

Download the zipped folder for the program, and extract both the Java and Python pair out into the directory where your compiler runs programs. Creating a new project in your compiler to house both files may be preferrable.

Once the files are in the compiler, run the program. Further instructions are in the program.
