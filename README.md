# Texas Hold 'Em Helper

Texas Hold Em' Helper is a program designed to help teach players who are new to this variant of poker on how to critically think about the plays they make during a game of it, encouraging players to make specific plays based on their hand and the available public cards on the table.

## Installation

(These instructions are intended for Windows machines.)

To install and use Texas Hold Em' Helper, you will first need to make sure you have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) and [Python](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pnrbtzxmb4z?hl=en-US&gl=US) downloaded on your machine.

When complete, first, download the source code to a desired folder (You can do this by clicking the bright green '<> Code' button, and clicking 'Download ZIP' from the dropdown menu it creates), and extract the contents into a new folder.

Then, open your Command Prompt. You can do this by searching for it in your Start menu, or by hitting Ctrl + R and typing 'cmd' into the prompt. Hit enter.

Once the Command Prompt is open, navigate the command prompt to the directory holding the program's files with 'cd'. You can do this by clicking the address bar at the top of the File Explorer, and copying it to your clipboard with Ctrl + C.
It should look something like this: 'cd C:\...\Downloads\ProjectSourceCode'. Hit enter.

Once the command prompt shows you that you are in the correct file, input these commands in this order. Make sure to wait for the Command Prompt to process before trying to input the next command:

javac *.java
java CardReader

This will open the program, and you should be able to use the program to evaluate the best moves you could make for your hand.
